I've always had this tense relationship with literature classics: most of the time I didn't understand them completely. I liked language fireworks of Ivo AndriÄ‡, but somehow could not relate to Ottoman Bosnia. Iliad was weird, chaotic and purposless. I loved inner reading of people from Dostoyevsky's Brothers Karamazov, but I could never manage to understand acting of any of the characters - mismanaged pride and that weird linkage of woman's chastity to man's self-purpose was just beyond me. It just seemed to me that in any situation the writer would imagine what would be the most stupid and irresponsable thing to do, and then continued writing on that.

But for this book, and it is the best book I read in 2017, I think it will become the classic of the early 21st century. I understood it, I could relate to some of the characters. It taught me about my own zeitgeist, my own age and it's peculiarities. Also it was hard, tears inducing hard. Since I got a child of my own I became very sensitive to children suffering, and this book has a lot of it. But it's worth it.

It's worth reading, and re-reading it again. And learning from it.
